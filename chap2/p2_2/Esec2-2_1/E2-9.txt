Exercise 2.9 : Explain the following definitions.For those that are illegal, explain what's wrong and how to correct it.
(A). std::cin >> int input_value;
This statement is wrong because "std::cin >>" is expecting a variable,
 or container, but is instead being given a variable definition, which is not 
the same. Additionally the context in which these two things happen would not 
implicitly initialize input_value. 


The proper way would be like this : 
int input_value; // definition without a value yet
std::cin >> input_value; // value given from standard input

(B) int i = {3.14}
This is also incorrect. While the syntax is correct, using the list initializer with a type that would truncate information results in an error. If you need to caste this do something like:

int i (3.14);

(C) double salary = wage = 9999.99;
In the current context wage has not been defined, if it was previously defined like so: 

double wage{}; 
double salary = wage = 9999.99;

This would work because wage{} would have been defined and initialized. in this case wage doesn't even need to initialized, and can be assigned, because it is being assigned in the statement.

(D) int i = 3.14
This is legal, but might lead to a compiler warning because loss of information
