What are the differences between int, long, long long, and short? Between an unsigned and a signed type? Between a float and a double? 

int only has 16 bits
long has 32 and long long has 64. There are no decimals to these.

I'm not sure what the different between an int and a short is, but apparently even though they are both 16 bit short has a smaller set than int.

The different between a float and double is that float is 6 sig digits and 
double is 10 sig digits.
