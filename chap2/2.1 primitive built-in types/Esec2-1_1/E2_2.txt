To calculate a mortgage payment, what types would you use for the rate, principal, and payment? Explain why you selected each type.

I'd use an unsigned float for the mortgage rate
Not sure what a mortgage principle is so i'll go ahead and use a signed double
payment would also be a unsigned double
