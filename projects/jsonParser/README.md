Parse a json string into a string of another data format

Prereqs ( as far as i know of )
String manipulation in c++
functions in c++
specifics on how recursion might difer from c++ and lisp and java

Use recursive descent parsing to format a json string into another data format string.

After i get this project to a certain point i'll probs make a new repo for it.
