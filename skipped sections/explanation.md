The purpose of this repository is to document learning c++ using the book c++ primer. 
I won't be doing all of the sections in the book. I'm focusing on learning as much as
I can, and some exercises don't actually test you on what you've learned, or provide 
exercises that allow you to demonstrate what you've learned in a succinct manner.
